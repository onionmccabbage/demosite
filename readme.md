## Stuff to think about
* Bibliograpy
* Github shared repository
* There are 5 sensors - do we need to distiguish between them?
* SQL or NoSQL (Mongo)
* Be clear which techology is operating where
* There are at least 2-3 computer systems involved
* Mock/dummy data for developing against
* Real data/historical data
* Someone needs to actually lay on sensor for significant periods of time
* Data 'density'
* Deliverables: what do they actually want (for assessment)
* Record the process: your thinking, why change mind, sample coe that you abandon...

### Projects to show ESP32 sensor data on a web page

Skim these ideas to see what's involved and help decide if minimal or 'full-fat' solution is needed.

*   [Minimal (serve data and HTML from ESP32)](https://circuits4you.com/2018/11/20/web-server-on-esp32-how-to-update-and-display-sensor-values/)
*   [Full-fat (project is PHP but can replace with Python)](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/esp32-esp8266-plot-chart-web-server/)

This image show the bits needed for a 'full-fat' solution (though I still recommend replacing PHP with Python)
